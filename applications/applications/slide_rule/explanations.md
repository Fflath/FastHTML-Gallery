# The slide ruler

* *Arms* - The arms are the white bars above and below the slider.

* *Indicator* - The indicator is the translucent red highlighter. In the middle of the indicator there is a line that is used to line up numbers on different scales.

* *Slider* - The slider is the center blue bar.

* *Scales* - Each scale represents a function. Scales are used in pairs to perform operations. Some pairs require movement and some are static. The name of each scale is found on the gold end piece to the left and right.

* *Zoom* - Below the first slide ruler is a second one. This is a zoomed in view of what is underneath the indicator.
